title: A Trip through Napa
---
After a semester of waiting, our group finally got the chance to participate in the annual SFDI wine tasting tour. To set the scene, it was a beautiful spring day in the Napa Valley, the vineyards were bearing new leaves, the flowers were in full bloom and rolling green hills dominated the horizon. It was quiet, peaceful and everything just felt alive. A welcome change from the day-to-day life in the concrete jungle that is the City.

After a couple of hours in the rumbling minibus, we arrived at our first stop, Burgess Cellars. Burgess Cellars is one of the oldest, continuously run wineries in the Valley. During the 1800s, Napa exploded with growth as wineries discovered that the Valley had the perfect climate, elevation, and soil to produce world class wine. When Prohibition hit the United States during the 1920s, demand for wine shrank and, subsequently, closed down hundreds of businesses. Burgess Cellars was able to survive by shifting their production focus to communion wines, one of the only facets of the alcohol industry not affected by Prohibition. 

When Steve Burgess, the patriarch of Burgess Cellars, came out to California in the 1960s he discovered, much like his predecessors in the 1800s, that the Napa Valley was a perfect place to make wine and the business has remained in the family ever since.

During the tasting itself, Tom Burgess, Steve’s son, served us a selection of 5 generously poured red wines. Something interesting that I hadn't realized before coming to Napa was that the Valley is broken up into various regions where different varieties of wine prosper. Things so minute such as slight changes in elevation and climate have profound effects on the wine itself. The region that we were in specialized in red wines such as cabernet and sauvignon, which was very apparent after tasting.

After Burgess we headed back home stopping at a more commercial winery called, Jacuzzi. While the wine was equally good to my unsophisticated palate, I couldn’t help but feel that this winery lacked the heart and soul that Burgess poured into their product, which made it more apparent that Burgess Cellar’s wine was a labor of love. That’s not to say that I didn’t come home with two bottles of Jacuzzi’s prosecco, an italian champagne. Overall, it was a great day and I will always remember it as one the best experiences I have had in the SFDI program and as a student at Miami University.
