title: The Magical Mystery Tour of Dolores Park
---

After a semester in San Francisco, Dolores Park, in its most recent incarnation, will always have a special place in my heart. It is a place that is reminiscent of a romanticized version San Francisco in the 1960s, where all walks of life, from the hippie to the yuppie, can come together to enjoy a sanctuary from typical societal standards. Along with this, the park offers one of the best views of the city, and it’s no surprise why people congregate there every weekend.

While Dolores is probably the best example of the giant frayed mosaic that is San Francisco, it also paves the way for unique characters who have made themselves famous among everyone in the city. One of the most notable people I have ever had the pleasure to meet was the colloquially known as the Truffle Man.

Every weekend, park goers search for the famous chocolatier in his iconic straw hat and artisan copper pots. His jovial demeanor and subtle accent brightens up any day in the Foggy City. This modern day Willy Wonka, creates chocolate truffles in an assortment of five flavors which include rum, espresso, pecan, and coconut. While I have never been able to partake in the Truffle Man’s products, he is evidence that San Francisco is a place that anyone can be anything they want to be. In this city, for the first time in my life, I feel I can be my authentic self.
