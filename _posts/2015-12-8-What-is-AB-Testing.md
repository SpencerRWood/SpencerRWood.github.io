As people, we A/B test every day whether we realize it or not. For example, let’s say there’s a new coffee shop around the corner that you’re excited to try. One morning, you decide to grab a cup of coffee and, in your excitement, you take a large drink. The coffee proves to be very hot and you end up burning your tongue in the process. As a result, you’ve learned that in the future you should either:

- A: Take smaller sips.
- B: Wait for your coffee to cool down before drinking.

The next day, after your tongue has healed, you go back to the same coffee shop to test your hypotheses. You start with your first test and attempt to take a smaller drink, but find out the coffee is still too hot to drink. This leads to your conclusion that it is better to wait for the coffee to cool down to a comfortable temperature before taking your first drink. 

But where do you go from here? 

You can continue testing by taking this a step further. For example, now that you can taste your coffee, you can try testing whether you enjoy a light versus a dark roast or which of the two employees makes the better cup of coffee, so on and so forth. In the end, you may prove a hypothesis or find out something new that wasn’t readily apparent to you before you beginning your testing. 

##What is A/B Testing?


As explained above, A/B testing follows a lean version of the scientific method. The scientific method is as follows: Form a question, research that question, create a hypothesis, measure the results of the hypothesis, and form a conclusion. This means that to begin an A/B test marketers must form a hypothesis based on a question and subsequent research involving two variables (A and B) with a means of evaluating these results to draw an eventual conclusion. In digital marketing the concept of A/B testing is continually being popularized among professionals because it is easy to carry out testing via web properties and digital ads. 

##How do we apply this to Marketing?

So let’s say there is a business that owns an eCommerce website that receives moderate traffic. The owner has integrated Google Analytics and would like to increase sales of his or her products on the site. This website’s general layout can be seen below.

The owner has already integrated Google Analytics and asks the initial question:

How can I increase sales on my site?

The owner, through research, finds out that other eCommerce sites have increased their sales by changing the layout of their website, more specifically, by moving details about the product from the right side of the picture to the left. The owner changes these elements on his site, as seen below, and begins his testing.

After running his test for a week, he finds out that contrary to what he researched, sales actually went down by a few percentage points on his website. He quickly changes his layout back to the original, and after a week he discovers sales have once again returned to normal. Through this experience, the owner has learned that changing this detail is detrimental to his website, and if he would like to increase sales he must explore other variables to tweak. 

The point of this thought exercise is to show that to truly optimize a website to answer a hypothesis question the owner must continue iterating on small changes to find what works and doesn’t work for users. Even in this case, although contrary to what the owner wanted to originally achieve, taught him or her that changing that specific aspect of the layout is harmful to sales. Failure in this sense is a great thing!

While changing the layout is only one example of creating two variables for testing, a marketer can also change various elements such as typography, colors, box sizes, nav displays and so on. One of the downsides of A/B testing is that, much like the scientific method when it comes to testing itself, is limited by the amount of variables introduced. Limiting the number of variables to two allows marketers to truly understand what changes do what on their websites. This is important to keep in mind, as complete overhauls to websites may give different conclusions than what is actually happening.

##Real World Examples

A majority of major internet properties and eCommerce stores are currently conducting A/B testing. Due to these changes being so incrementally small, users typically don’t notice on a conscious level.
