title: The City of San Francisco

_“This is a city of curious people” — Glenn Platt_

For the first few weeks that I have been in San Francisco this has been one of the greatest experiences that I have ever had. Instantly I found a group of great friends willing to explore the city with me finding cool things to do along the way. Some of the memories that I have made so far are learning how to surf in the Pacific, eating at some of great restaurants around the city, enjoying the various parks, and watching the sunset with friends.

Along with this, I was incredibly lucky to find a job doing digital brand management at a startup company in the Runway incubator located in the Twitter building. This company is called ClinkMe, soon to be BOOM, and it is a ephemeral group messaging app. My job is self-lead and my coworkers, who are based around the world, have been kind and welcoming. At Runway I get my own desk and monitor while being surrounded by 80 other startups. Everyone is interested in each other’s work and willing to help each other out, people call this networking but it the attitude of helping your neighbor seems incredibly genuine and altruistic. For my first week the CEO of my company was out of San Francisco doing investor meetings in Los Angeles the two guys next to my desk noticed and invited me to lunch to hear what my story was. Like Glenn said, this is a city of incredibly curious people.

So far in this city I have had some of best experiences by not saying no when an opportunity presents itself and because of this I know that this is going to be the best semester of school I have had at Miami.

_Laughing among friends –  
Palate cleansing for the soul  
A welcome relief._
