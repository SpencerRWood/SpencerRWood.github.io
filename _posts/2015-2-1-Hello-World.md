title: Hello World!

My name is Spencer and this is my blog. While studying/interning in San Francisco, I discovered the importance of having a place on the Internet that you can call your own.

I set out with the goal of carving out my own space to showcase work and, more importantly, who I am as a person without the use of content management system (CMS). This is due to two incredibly profound reasons: 

1. I have always had a passion for building things myself. 
2. As a college student, I am incredibly cheap and donâ€™t want to pay for hosting.

Essentially, this is a personal experiment in digital self-sufficiency. 

As of right now, this blog will be a combination of my life experiences, various topics involving the technology industry and marketing, and my ever growing list of activities that I enjoy. This will be a tentative list, and will be subject to change in the future as I figure things out.

If you are interested in seeing more from me, my twitter and instagram are @SpencerRWood.
