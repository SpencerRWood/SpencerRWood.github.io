Hello! First and foremost, thank you for checking out my website! I am a recent Miami University (of Ohio) graduate with a BS in Marketing and and a BA in Interactive Media Studies. During college, I was able to explore some of my passions for innovation, technology, and digital marketing by spending a semester living and working in downtown San Francisco - pretty cool for an Ohio native, right?

 While in the Bay Area I did digital marketing for a startup company in an accelerator program focused on developing a mobile ephemeral messaging platform while also being exposed to other innovative startups in our program. Throughout this experience I had the opportunity to adopt a project management role where I worked with our C-level executives, along with leading a small team, to develop, build, and implement new features for our platform with the purpose to engage and grow our user base.
 
 My time in San Francisco was an overall great experience but now I am looking to bring my knowledge, talents, and capabilities to the Cincinnati area. In the near future, I hope to be involved in some capacity with Ohio's own growing startup community, whether that means working for a company outright or volunteering my time to work with one of the City's great incubation or accelerator programs.
